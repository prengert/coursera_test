<!-- In this module, we will be building a real website for a client (a restaurant) -->

<!-- ***** Before the visit with the Client ***** -->
<!-- 	-Most clients have no idea what they want.
			-It's your job to figure out what they want
			-Bring examples of web sites for similar businesses
		-Every client is going to want to put a lot of important information on the page.
			-When everything is important, nothing is important
			-Less is more
			-Encourage client to not cram too much info into the site
			-Help the client identify the most crucial information
		-Find a way for the client to invest in the project.
			-If they aren't invested, you become a side project.
			-Have them commit to pay for product photography or similar things
		-Have the client designate one person responsible for decisions.
			-Otherwise there will be too many talking heads
		-Limit the number of revisions up front.
			-Otherwise the client will ask for infinite revisions
			-If it's a paying job, limit the number of free revisions.
		-Google for 'web development client questionnaire'.
		-Involve others if needed. (designers/photographers/etc.)
		-Get an idea of what the client currently has.-->

<!-- ***** Visit with the Client Notes ***** -->

<!-- ***** Design Overview ***** -->
<!-- Don't just start coding the website. Make some mock-ups first and get them approved. Then you can start coding the website. balsamiq.com provides a mock-up tool. Balsamiq is a good tool (although not free) because it is html based, thus can easily be included in a repository. Jumbotron image underneath navigation. Then the most important elements. Design is meant to come up with something with enough detail that you can begin to code.-->
